The sky was an unusual shade of purple this morning when I woke up. Not the gentle lavender of dawn, but a deep, almost bruised violet that seemed to pulse with its own strange energy. It's been three months since the atmospheric experiments began, and while the government assures us these chromatic anomalies are harmless, I'm not entirely convinced.
I had breakfast with Mom via hologram today. The connection was better than last week - only glitched twice during our hour-long chat. She's adjusting well to the Mars colony, though she complains about the soil quality in her garden dome. Apparently, growing heirloom tomatoes in modified Martian soil is trickier than the brochures suggested. Dad remains on Earth, stubbornly refusing to join her until "they sort out that gravity business." Their interplanetary marriage counselor says this arrangement might actually be strengthening their relationship. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, especially when that distance spans 140 million miles.
Work was chaotic today. Our neural interface system crashed during a major client demo, leaving twenty executives temporarily stuck in a shared mindscape of an ancient Greek marketplace. Fortunately, the emergency protocols kicked in after eight minutes, though Mr. Henderson from Accounting was still speaking in Homeric verse during the afternoon budget meeting. IT says it was a minor glitch, but I've backed up my consciousness to an external drive just to be safe.
My sister called with exciting news—her application for the genetic retrospective program was approved! Next month, she’ll get to meet a reconstructed simulation of our great-great-grandmother. Apparently, they’ve extracted enough DNA from preserved hairbrushes and letters to create a 94% accurate personality construct. On my commute home, I stopped by that new synthetic food market everyone's been raving about. Bought a molecule cartridge promising "The Complete Taste Experience of a 2005 Christmas Dinner." It was surprisingly accurate, though the Brussels sprouts algorithm needs tweaking. Something about the texture was off - too much like memory foam, not enough like vegetables. Still, the nostalgic flavor profile of foods from the pre-Climate Shift era is impressive technology. Twenty years ago, who would have thought we'd be downloading our meals?
The neighborhood drone patrol flagged a Level 2 anomaly near the park again. That's the third one this week. The community forum is buzzing with theories - everything from quantum displacement to teenagers with illegal scrambling tech. Personally, I think it's that old woman from number 43 testing her homebrew teleportation device again. Last month her cat appeared inside four different houses on the same day. She claimed it was "just an unusually stealthy cat," but we all know better.

Apparently, they've extracted enough DNA from preserved hairbrushes and letters to create a 94% accurate personality construct. She promised to ask all the family history questions we've wondered about. I'm skeptical about how authentic these reconstructions really are, but it means a lot to her, especially since she's been researching our genealogy since the public DNA archives went open-source.
The new emotional regulation implant is working better than expected. When my autonomous vehicle took a wrong turn and added twenty minutes to my journey home, I felt the familiar surge of frustration, then a gentle neurochemical correction that left me contemplating the interesting architecture along the detour route. The doctor warned about the “flattening effect,” but I haven’t experienced that yet. I still cried during that commercial with the robot dog finding its way home. Some emotions should remain untouched, I think. There’s a kind of reassurance in knowing my tears are still mine.
Had dinner with Alex tonight. We tried that new place where the chef is an advanced culinary AI paired with robotic arms. The food was technically perfect but lacked something intangible. Alex disagrees and thinks I’m just being a techno-skeptic again. Maybe I am. The conversation turned to our upcoming Iceland trip—we’re among the last tourist group allowed to see the final glacier before it disappears next month. There’s something melancholy about planning a vacation around witnessing the end of something ancient. Alex suggested we bring back a vial of meltwater as a keepsake, but I’m not sure I want a reminder that tangible.
Before bed, I spent an hour in the retrotech room, listening to vinyl records and reading an actual paper book. No screens, no augmentation, no connectivity. These analog evenings are becoming my favorite ritual. There’s something comforting about technology that doesn’t watch you back. The psychological benefits of regular digital detoxing are well-documented, but beyond the health aspects, there’s a peculiar joy in experiencing art through imperfect, physical mediums. A tiny scratch on the record, the smell of old paper—these imperfections make the moment feel more alive than the flawless streams of data I consume the rest of the day.
Tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of The Merge, when the first human consciousness was successfully uploaded to the cloud. The commemorative broadcasts have been running all week. I wonder what Jensen would say about how his legacy has evolved. His digital self has spawned fourteen distinct personality forks, each arguing they represent his true intentions. The philosophical and legal questions continue to multiply faster than legislation can address them. In some ways, it’s reassuring—proof that even in the digital realm, humans can still find ways to disagree with themselves.
It’s nearly midnight now. Through my window, I can see the neighbors’ garden illuminated by bioluminescent plants, gently pulsing in blues and greens. The air smells faintly of something floral—probably engineered—but pleasant all the same. Somewhere in the distance, I hear the faint hum of a cargo drone passing overhead, on its way to a night delivery. Despite all the strangeness of modern life, there are still moments of pure beauty that would translate to any time in human history. Perhaps that’s enough.
Until tomorrow,
Blake Man
